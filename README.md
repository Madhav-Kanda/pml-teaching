Slides and Notebooks for my Probabilistic Machine Learning Course

There are several excellent resources I heavily relied on to create this course. I would like to thank the authors of these resources for making them available to the public (in no particular order)

1. Piyush Rai (IIT Kanpur) excellent course and slides on the same subject
2. Philip Hennig (University of TÃ¼bingen) excellent course and slides on the same subject
3. Kevin Murphy (Google) excellent book on the same subject
4. Ben Lambert has a great book and [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwJRxp3blEvZ8AKMXOy0fc0cqT61GsKCG) on the same subject
